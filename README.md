# Monte Carlo Method with OpenMP and Async

This repository demonstrates a sample implementation of the Monte Carlo method using OpenMP for parallelism and `std::async` for asynchronous programming in C++.

## Features

- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**:
  - Implemented using both OpenMP and `std::async` for parallelism.
- **Vector Addition**:
  - Parallelized using OpenMP.
- **Utility Functions**:
  - Includes basic utility functions for demonstration purposes.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++14 or later (e.g., `g++`).
- OpenMP support enabled in the compiler.

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the source files and create the executable.

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application with the following command:

```
make run
```

## TODO

Benchmark and compare monte carlo method for different iterations.
